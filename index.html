			<p>Throughout my life, I am proud to say I’ve lived in three different continents hence having the pleasure of crossing paths and working alongside with amazing people from very diverse cultures. My professional life then consisted mostly of help desk support and IT teams’ management related stuff.</p>
			<p>Yet, while happily jumping between Angola, Mexico and Portugal, I’ve always felt the need to step-up my game and to dive head-on into the ways of the dopest of all geek skills, aka programming. With that in mind, I started using online resources to self-taught myself into web development on my spare times. That passion kept growing, up to the point that I had the urge to leave everything behind and jump ahead with my education by risking joining <Academia de Código_>’s programming bootcamp in order to become the accomplished frontend developer I knew I could be. And I am glad I did so. Currently, I am head over heels with clean code and as ready as can be to take on my next professional challenge. I'm your cheerful “improvise-adapt-overcome” kind of dude and a true believer in hard work.</p>
			<p>Always trying to get out of my comfort zone, I tend to make a point in never leaving anyone behind while doing so. I'm also happily married to an awesome beautiful wife and - together - we're doing our best to raise the coolest little girl on the universe. BTW, I forgot to mention… I loooove cheesy “Star Wars” t-shirts and my official nickname is “Luke”!</p>
